# Hi.
I'm a Minecraft plugin developer from Australia.
All of my Spigot projects have a focus on extensive configurations, look and performance.
My rule for plugins are 'I would never publish something I wouldn't use' (except requests of course).

## Current Projects
#### SpigotMC Resources:
- PhantomCombat: a SpigotMC plugin focused on enhancing the combat experience.

#### Servers:
- None are live yet. In development :)

## Upcoming Projects
#### SpigotMC Resources:
- PhantomLobby (releasing soon!): the first plugin to look for when setting up a lobby.
- PhantomCore: merges the necessities for running a server into one file.
- PhantomModeration: make your moderator's jobs simple with a mod mode command.

#### Servers:
- Unsure if I should chose Skyblock or Survival.
